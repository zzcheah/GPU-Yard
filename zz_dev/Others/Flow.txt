Set Up:
1.  Start MongoDB
2.  Start Docker Daemon
3.  Start Eureka Server
4.  Start MainServer
5.  Start TaskWorker


Flow:
(Main Server - frontend)
1.  User chooses Docker Image (each image has its own functionality)
2.  User enters parameters required for the docker image
3.  User enter zipped file
4.  User submit request

(Main Server - backend)
5.  Request registered into mongoDB collections (REQUESTS & TASKS)
6.  Request added into in memory queue (blocking queue)

(Main Server - pooling thread)
7.  Constantly checking for job in queue (thread blocked when nothing in queue until the thread is notified)
8.  MachineID is pooled from a machine queue to process the job pooled
9.  Send API request to the selected machine
10. Assign to next machineID in queue if API response has error
11. Update request status to 'PROCESSING'

(Task Worker)
12. Received requestID from Main Server
13. Retrieve request details from MongoDB
    a.  Docker Image
    b.  Encoded JSON parameters
    c.  Input File ID
14. Create a docker container from the docker image with the following environment variables:
    a.  Download url for zipped input files
    b.  Upload url to store zipped output files after done processing
    c.  Encoded JSON parameter
15. Add script file into container
16. Launch the container to process the request

(Inside docker container)
17. importing the script does the following:
    a.  download file
    b.  provide functions to upload output file
    c.  decode JSON parameters
18. run the Machine learning logic
19. upload output file to main server using function from the script
20. upload function will update request status
