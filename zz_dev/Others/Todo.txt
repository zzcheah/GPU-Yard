Task Worker:
-> preprocess workload, get related information (API url, etc)
-> retrieve inputFiles, param
-> connect to docker daemon
-> launch container to process the request
-> append error and remarks to the requests




Common (java package to be shared) :
-> constants for collection names and other repetitive strings. dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss
-> optimize to reduce redundancy and improve consistency

Additional:
-> notify user when finish processing
-> how task workers know the address of main server
-> design inputFiles folder hierarchy (should use zip)
Idea:
1.  zip in a specific tree
2.  extract inside/outside container to be determined
3.  Extraction
    a.  Inside (download from main server through api)
        - python extract in volume within container
    b.  Outside (retrieve from main server through mongodb)
        - java extract in machine volume
        - container attach to the directory
4.  Process
5.  Upload Output files
    a.  Inside (upload to main server through api)
        - python zip file and upload through upload link
    b.  Outside (save to main server through mongodb)
        - java save the files in attached volume to mongodb
6.  Send API call to release machine slot
