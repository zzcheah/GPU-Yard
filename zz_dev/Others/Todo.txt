Backend Queue:
- Java Queue for popping queue
- Backup queue in mongoDB
- send api call to machine to process the job

-> convert json from React to RequestDetail Java Object
-> edit the RequestDetail structure to be saved in mongo
-> remove queue record from mongo after finish processing (either during machine learning or another api) // tbh


Additional:
-> restore queue from mongo (persistent) after restart
-> update status of request in different phases.
-> constants for collection names and other repetitive strings.



API:
- get job/task from queue // canceled
