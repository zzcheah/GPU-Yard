MLaaS Logic:
-> sample MLaaS logic (build model from extracted files and input params)
-> prebuild functions/scripts
   1.   download input zip and extract the files
   2.   decode json param
   3.   upload output zip
   4.   call api to release machine along with remarks


Task Worker:
-> API to receive requestID
-> retrieve docker image and encoded json param from request
-> pass main server API urls to the container


Common (java package to be shared) :
-> constants for collection names and other repetitive strings. dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss
-> optimize to reduce redundancy and improve consistency

Additional:
-> notify user when finish processing
-> how task workers know the address of main server
