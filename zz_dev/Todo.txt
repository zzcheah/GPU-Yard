Main Server:
-> return only jwt with user profile as claim
-> Rest Controller for React (request details, user details)

React:
-> decode user profile from jwt
-> optimize loading from local storage in React Context
-> fetch data from backend and map to components
-> download button from download link (download output files)

MLaaS Logic:
-> prebuild functions/scripts
   3.   upload output zip
   4.   call api to release machine along with remarks

Integration testing:
-> different machine testing (on cloud maybe)
   * cors testing
   * mongodb connections



Additional:
-> notify user when finish processing


*** Critical ***
-> error running container after windows update
