In this demo, I will be presenting the flow from submitting request to how the output is generated.
Please note that the front end of this system is still under development, so everything in this demo will be about the backend of the system.

Before this, I would like to explain some of the software or tools that I will be using later.

1. Postman
Since I do not have a UI for this demo, I will be using postman to send API calls to the backend server to represent how a user submit a request

2. Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is a GUI for docker engine, we will be using it to see a container status, access to the container in command line.

3. Robo 3T
A GUI to interact with mongoDB

****************************************************************

Currently, i have started 3 different servers, which are:
1. The main server
2. A task worker or the remote worker
3. Eureka server

The main server and the task worker are meant to be hosted on different machine.
However, for this demo, the servers will be hosted on the same machine.

The main server is the master while the task worker is the slave.
Main Server will receive input from the user and assign it to the task worker to process the request.

Now I will use Postman to submit a request.
